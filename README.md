# CoronaJump
 
**A Covid-19 inspired mobile game**

This project was created to learn/practice c++ and using the unity workflow. 
At the time of creation the pandemic was in its early stages, hence the idea to make a game of a similar theme.

## The Game

This game involves the player jumping up from platform to platform without falling while avoiding infected characters.

### How does it work?

Platform objects are procedurally generated above the camera view as the player's 'y' position approaches the top of the screen.
As this happens, every game object beneath the player's view are deleted.
